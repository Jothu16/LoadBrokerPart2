# LoadBrokerPart2

LoadBrokerPart2 is an innovative loadboard platform designed to revolutionize the freight and logistics industry. This project aims to streamline the process of finding and booking freight loads for carriers, while also providing functionalities for freight brokers and shippers.

Key Features
Load Matching: Carriers can easily find loads by selecting their desired routes, such as California to Texas. The platform shows available loads, prioritizing the most profitable options based on the carrier's truck specifications and average MPG.
Route Optimization: Offers both direct and alternative routing options. For instance, a carrier might choose a direct California to Texas route or an alternative route via Arizona for higher profitability.
Smart Booking: Ensures carriers book only one load at a time to prevent overbooking and no-shows, especially for alternative routes.
User Types: Supports three user categories - freight carriers, freight brokers, and shippers. Each category has tailored functionalities to suit their specific needs.
Intuitive UI: Inspired by user-friendly interfaces like Robinhood and UberFreight, ensuring ease of use.
API Integration: Seamlessly integrates with external APIs like DAT and TruckStopGo for real-time load data.
Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js with Express.js
Database: Choice between MongoDB and PostgreSQL
API Integration: DAT, TruckStopGo, and other relevant APIs
Hosting: Cloud-based solutions (AWS or Google Cloud Platform)
Project Status
